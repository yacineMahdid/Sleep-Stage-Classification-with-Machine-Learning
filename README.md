# Sleep Stage Classification with Machine Learning
Various experiment with brain data to classify sleep stage using machine learning.

Currently, most of the code is being drafted here [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Ram_eWOAu_JM-jKC0qySbU7dA8W1kan#scrollTo=yMZqCPMMeB7s)

## Experiment 1 : Polysomnography data with 2 participants
Code is mainly inspired by this tutorial in [MNE python](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/clinical/60_sleep.html#sphx-glr-auto-tutorials-clinical-60-sleep-py).

The methodology is inspired by this article titled [A deep learning architecture for temporal sleep stage classification
using multivariate and multimodal time series](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/tnsre.2018.2813138).

The data comes from this study and is called PhysioNet: [PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet : Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signal](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.e215)


### Overview and Definitions
**Definition**
- *polysomnography*: Polysomnography is a multi-parameter type of sleep study and a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. The test result is called a polysomnogram, also abbreviated PSG.
